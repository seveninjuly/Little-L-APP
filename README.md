On the start screen, users can start a search for different categories of gifs, such as animals, celebrities and so on. 
If they don’t find the one they love in the current results, they can click the “want more?” button to get new ones, or click the search icon on the top right corner to start a new search.

If they want to check out the jokes, they can click the “Little Extra” on the top to get random jokes. One joke will be displayed at a time, and just like the gifs, they can always use the “want more?” button to get another joke.
