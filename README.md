On the start screen, users can start a search for different categories of gifs, such as animals, celebrities and so on. 
If they don’t find the one they love in the current results, they can click the _“want more?”_ button to get new ones, or click the _search icon_ on the top right corner to start a new search.

If they want to check out the jokes, they can click the _“Little Extra”_ on the top to get random jokes. One joke will be displayed at a time, and just like the gifs, they can always use the _“want more?”_ button to get another joke.
